see =./headlines.org=
*** DONE [[https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous/issues/31][#31]]: Support #+INCLUDE
Note that only src/example/export block inclusion is supported for now.
There's quite a lot more to include (see the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Include-files.html][org manual for include files]]) but I
don't have a use case for this yet and stuff like namespacing footnotes of included files
adds quite a bit of complexity.

for now files can be included as:
- src block
  #+INCLUDE: "./headlines.org" src org
- export block
  #+INCLUDE: "./paragraphs.html" export html
- example block
  #+INCLUDE: "../../.github/workflows/ci.yml" example yaml

** issues (wrongly) filed with hugo
*** [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3874][#3874]] exporting images in org mode
Hello, I'm writing hugo blogs using org-mode.

When inserting an image link like [[/home/amos/Pictures/Screenshots/img-2017-09-11-165647.png]], hugo doesn't export the image.
*** [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4006][#4006]] source code blocks in org not rendered correctly

** misc fuzz / regression / edge case
*** index out of range in headline priority parsing

**** followed by a child headline
- followed by another list item
* Footnotes

[fn:1] a footnote /with/ *markup*
- and a *list*
- because that's possible
