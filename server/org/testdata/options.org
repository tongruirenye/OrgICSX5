#+OPTIONS: toc:nil f:nil e:nil

* DONE [#A] =#+OPTIONS:= toggles supported by =go-org=                 :tag1:tag2:
=go-org= supports multiple export toggles as described in the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html][export settings]] section of the Org mode manual.
By default (most of?) those toggles are enabled. This file starts with =#+OPTIONS: toc:nil f:nil e:nil= and thus
disables the table of contents, footnotes & entities.
That means, entities like =---= --- (mdash) will be left untouched, footnotes like =[fn:1]= [fn:1] will
not be exported and there won't be a table of contents at the top.
As buffer options are merged with the defaults, the above headline will be exported *with* priority, todo status & tags.
