* CUSTOM headline with custom status
it's possible to use =#+SETUPFILE= - in this case the setup file contains the following

#+INCLUDE: "setup_file_org" src org
* excluded headline                                                :custom_noexport:
this headline and it's content are not exported as it is marked with an =EXCLUDE_TAGS= tag.
By default =EXCLUDE_TAGS= is just =:noexport:=.

* malformed property drawer
:PROPERTIES:
not a property
:END:
* level limit for headlines to be included in the table of contents
The toc option allows setting a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html][level limit]]. For this file we set it to 1 - which means that the following headlines
won't be included in the table of contents.
** headline 2 not in toc
*** headline 3 not in toc
** anoter headline 2 not in toc
you get the gist...
