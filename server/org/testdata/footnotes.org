* Using some footnotes
- normal footnote reference [fn:1] [fn:6] [fn:foo-bar] (footnote names can be anything in the format =[\w-]=)
- further references to the same footnote should not [fn:1] render duplicates in the footnote list
- inline footnotes are also supported via [fn:2:the inline footnote definition].
- anonymous inline footnotes are also supported via [fn::the anonymous inline footnote definition].
- Footnote definitions are not printed where they appear.
  Rather, they are gathered and exported at the end of the document in the footnote section. [fn:4]
- footnotes that reference a non-existant definition are rendered but log a warning [fn:does-not-exist]

[fn:4] so this definition will not be at the end of this section in the exported document.
Rather, it will be somewhere down below in the footnotes section.

[fn:5] this definition will also not be exported here - not only that, it will be overwritten by a definition
of the same name later on in the document. That will log a warning but carry on nonetheless.
* Footnotes
Please note that the footnotes section is not automatically excluded from the export like in emacs. [fn:7]

[fn:foo-bar] yolo

[fn:1] https://www.example.com
- footnotes can contain *markup*
- and other elements
  - like blocks
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    other non-plain
    #+END_SRC
  - and tables
    | 1 | a |
    | 2 | b |
    | 3 | c |

[fn:3] [[http://example.com/unused-footnote][example.com/unused-footnote]]

[fn:5] another unused footnote (this definition overwrites the previous definition of =fn:5=)

[fn:6]

Footnotes break after two consecutive empty lines - just like paragraphs - see https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html.
This shouldn't happen when the definition line and the line after that are empty.


[fn:7]
There's multiple reasons for that. Among others, doing so requires i18n (to recognize the section) and silently
hides content before and after the footnotes.



this is not part of [fn:7] anymore as there are 2 blank lines in between!
