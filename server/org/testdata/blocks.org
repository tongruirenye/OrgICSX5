#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE foo bar baz
an example block with
multiple lines including


empty lines!

it also has multiple parameters

src, example & export blocks treat their content as raw text
/inline/ *markup* is ignored
      and whitespace is honored and not removed

content of example blocks is still html escaped - see <script>alert("escaped")</script>
#+END_EXAMPLE

: examples like this
: are also supported
:
: note that /inline/ *markup* ignored

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mongodb is *webscale*. (source: [[http://www.mongodb-is-web-scale.com/][mongodb-is-web-scale]])

blocks like the quote block parse their content and can contain
- lists
- inline /markup/
- tables
  | foo |
  | bar |
  | baz |
- paragraphs
- ...

      whitespace is honored and not removed (but is not displayed because that's how html works by default)
        it can be made visible using css (e.g. =white-space: pre=).

- list item 1
  blocks can contain unindented lines that would normally end a list item
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
this line is not indented - if it was outside of a block the list item would end
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
this line is not indented - if it was outside of a block the list item would end
  #+END_QUOTE
  now we're outside the block again and the following unindented line will be outside of the list item
this unindented line is outside of the list item
